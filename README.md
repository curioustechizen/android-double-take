android-double-take
===================

Simple animation helpers for Android. The aim is to provide an easy way for developers to incorporate simple animations into their apps, without having to worry about the implementation details.

To start off, this library provides a couple of animations described in the Android Training ["Adding Animations"](http://developer.android.com/training/animation/index.html) class.


##Currently Implemented:

  - CrossFade animation
  - Zoom animation


##Usage:

android-double-take is provided as an Android library project. Declare your Android application project to depend on android-double-take. Take a look at the sample to see how to use the animations.


##ToDos:
  
  - Provide a way to hook into the animation lifecycle - i.e., provide the library client code a callback similar to `AnimatorListenerAdapter`
  - Add other animations
