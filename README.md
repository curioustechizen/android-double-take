###Note: This library is still under development.

android-double-take
===================

Simple animation helpers for Android. The aim is to provide an easy way for developers to incorporate simple animations into their apps, without having to worry about the implementation details.

To start off, this library provides a couple of animations described in the Android Training ["Adding Animations"](http://developer.android.com/training/animation/index.html) class.


##ToDos:
  
  - Documentation
  - Add ZoomAnimation
  - Add sample project demonstrating usage of the library
  - Provide a way to hook into the animation lifecycle - i.e., provide the library client code a callback similar to `AnimatorListenerAdapter`
  - Backward compatibility with Jake Wharton's NineOldAndroids (??)
